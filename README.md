# Mansplain Study Repository

This repository supports a research study examining gender dynamics and perceived tone in chatbot interactions. The study includes three different chatbot conditionsâ€”**Compassionate**, **Default**, and **Mansplain**â€”each implemented as a standalone Gradio app. 

A transcription tool is also included to assist with converting participant recordings into text using Whisper and Streamlit.

## Overview

- **Chatbot Conditions**: Each folder under study/ contains one condition of the chatbot experiment, implemented using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/). Each app includes logic for interactive conversations and stores chat logs to a local folder named data/.

- **Transcription Tool**: A separate tool is included to assist researchers in transcribing audio responses from participants. This tool is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and uses [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for transcription.

Running the Apps

Chatbot Conditions
In each app.py file, set your OpenAI API key:
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

Each chatbot condition is a separate Gradio app. To run one:

Replace mansplain with default or compassionate to run the others.

Conversation logs are saved under the respective data/ folder as CSVs

Logs are tied to participants via a query parameter (?id=participant123)



Transcription Tool
streamlit run transcribe.py
This launches a web-based UI for uploading participant audio and generating transcripts using Whisper.

ðŸ“„ Conversation Logging
Each app logs conversations as CSV files named after the user ID (e.g., participant123.csv)

Logs include role-labeled entries (system, user, assistant) and timestamps

Files are stored in data/ inside the corresponding condition folder
